# Timetable Management System

This project is a web-based **Timetable Management System** where users can enter their faculty and module codes to generate a personalized timetable. The system also allows users to add the generated timetable to their calendar. It handles module codes with or without spaces, and it provides notifications for invalid module codes that are not available in the database.

### Features:
- Allows users to input module codes manually.
- Notifies users when they enter invalid or unrecognized module codes.
- Normalizes module codes (handles case insensitivity and spaces).
- Generates a timetable based on the entered module codes.
- Option to add the timetable to a calendar in `.ics` format (with weekly repetition until November 8, 2024).
